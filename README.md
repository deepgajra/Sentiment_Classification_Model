# Sentiment Classification Model using NLTK and ML

## Description:
This project implements a sentiment classification model using NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) and machine learning techniques. The model is trained to classify text data into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.

## Model:
The sentiment classification model uses a combination of NLTK for text preprocessing and scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes or Support Vector Machines (SVM).

## Installation:
- Python 3.x
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- scikit-learn

You can install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install nltk scikit-learn
